        <h1>Project Description</h1>

        <p>
            Our project Passfree, is a web-based password manager for websites and applications that users can utilize to provide them with safety and to prevent password loss or leaks while the services that we offer are in effect. Notably, Passfree’s main features will be support for passwords as well as 2FA seeds which are often used as a second layer of protection by businesses such as Google, banks and cryptocurrency wallets. This then enables the user to have an area in the cloud system for which they can save their passwords and save them time for memorising and typing their passwords.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to that, the users would be able to access the passwords anytime they wish using the web-application available. Should you want access to your passwords, we allow exportation of your passwords when asked anytime with the two factor authenticating keys that you use for them. To top it off, our services also utilizes a master key encryption to ensure that your passwords are secure and cannot be easily accessed by anyone.
            Moreover, our extra features will not only notify you if your passwords have been compromised so you can change them, but it will also send you timely reminders to update them if you want to ensure maximum security. And for those who have many accounts, we allow you to organise your passwords so you can separate your most important accounts from the least important ones.

                <p>My name is Areeb Majeed and I am from Kashmir and I am 20 years old. I'm currently studying Bachelor in Information Technology at RMIT University. I have completed my Year 12 from Tyndale Biscoe School located in the heart of Srinagar. I can speak English, Urdu and Kashmiri. I have a rich experience working with PHP, but in addition to that I have also used other languages such as Golang, Javascript, Java, etc. In my free time, I usually play games such as Overwatch, follow cryptocurrencies and freelance.</p>
                <p>My strongest asset is my experience with programming. However, on the other hand, one of my greatest weakness is my poor communication habits. I hope to learn about team-work, develop my communication skills, gain some confidence while working on this project. My current challenge while working on this project would be to create and write reports. In regards to this project, I see myself contributing to the codebase, developing the frontend of the website and writing the project reports.</p>

Prior to this, I was a Mass Communication Graduate in the Philippines and worked as a translator and then a copywriter. I can speak English and Tagalog. I have little experience with programming, only having some experience with RPGMaker. I love playing video games, especially Overwatch, drawing, reading, and writing stories.</p>
                <p>My strongest asset, I believe, is my writing experience and patience as well as being a team player. However, my greatest weakness at the moment is my lackluster skills in programming due to my inexperience and I am currently working on improving my skills. To that extent, my current challenges in this project would have to be my fear of being unable to offer anything to my more experienced groupmates besides what little I can do. For now, I see myself helping the team by supporting them through dredges of paperwork and ideas while dabbling in minor editing with HTML or some
                    basic programming.</p>

                <p>Hello! My name is Simon Nguyen. Born in australia, I turned 18 this year. By pure luck, I'm studying Bachelor in Information Technology at RMIT. Chilled past year 12 at Braybrook college doing IT and computing subjects. I can speak a bit of vietnamese, but im not fluent(kinda depressing when you think about it, 18 years and you can't speak your second lanugage well). I have basic c++ coding skills, mostly form creation and simple calulation coding. I enjoy reading storys on reddit and manga in my spare time. If you're looking for a sick place to read short stories, head over
                    to r/hfy. yeeeehhhh!</p>
                <p>My strongest asset is probs my creativity and the ability to get along with people easily. What I'm lacking is my knowledge coding skills, with the assignment being to code and make something work in 12 weeks makes my brain confused. My current challenges in this project is to probs just do what they tell me to do. I'm afraid of letting the team down due to my lesser knowledge on the languages that we are using, so by letting them tell me what I should do it will help guide me. </p>

                <p>My name is Kimberley Tan, I’m turning 20 later this year and I graduated from high school in 2018. Throughout highschool, I have chosen to do IT subjects and have now chosen to study a bachelor of IT as technology is something that is used in everyday life, it involves different aspects and is an ever growing industry. I’ve always found technology interesting as it allows me to play games, be creative and communicate with others.</p>
                <p>My strongest asset is my creativity and ability to write reports however my weak point is coding. At the moment, I have basic knowledge in Java and have worked with HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript in the past. I would like to learn more and refine my coding skills. A main challenge for me in relation to our project is the thought of not being able to contribute as much as I would like to due to my limited knowledge and experience. For this project, I can see myself contributing to a lot of the writing, planning or designing aspects and helping my other team members out with
                    the coding so that I can gain some knowledge from them and improve upon my weaknesses.</p>

                <p>My strongest assets are my communication and creativity skills in terms of UX and UI because I've had previous experience handling projects that were heavily focused on the considerations of the discrimination act, so it now comes naturally to take those on board when designing. I am inexperienced in coding and want to further develop my skills and learn to become proficient by the end of the semester. I have some background to Javascript but not PHP and I would like to further my JS skills and afterwards PHP. I'm ready to dive into contributing to the coding aspects of this

        <h1>Desirable Outcomes</h1>

        <h2>Main Features:</h2>

        <br>

        <h3>Password and 2FA Support</h3>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The web-application will support passwords and 2FA (TOTP). Users would be able to store their passwords and 2FA keys securely with the password manager.</p>
        <p><b>Validation:</b> A successful implementation would mean that the users are able to copy the stored passwords and generated OTPs from the application.</p>
        <p><b>User Story:</b> As an old grandfather, I want to be able to copy and paste my passwords I already have into what I am using, so that I do not have to remember the passwords for websites I use. </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Cloud Backup</h3>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The passwords and 2FA seeds created by the user would be stored on the cloud. In order to prevent any leaks or data theft, the user information would be encrypted by a master key.</p>
        <p><b>Validation:</b> In order to test this feature, the user would have to initially store some passwords on the application and then delete it from their device. After they delete the application, they must reinstall it and log back in to see if they are able to access their passwords again without having to add them again.</p>
        <p><b>User Story:</b> As a teacher, I want to be able to cloud save all my students passwords securely with no hassle. I want to do this because it is readily available for when my students need them but also do not have a physical holding of these passwords.</p>


        <br>

        <h3>Master Key Encryption</h3>
        <p><b>Description:</b> A secure password manager should be able to safeguard the user passwords, even in the event of a hack, leak, or theft. Therefore, the passwords stored on the cloud would be encrypted by a master key provided by the user. This ensures that even if the data is leaked or hacked, the hackers would not be able to access the passwords.</p>
        <p><b>Validation:</b> Each time the user installs the application on a new device, he/she would have to re-enter their master key to decrypt the existing passwords.</p>
        <p><b>User Story:</b> As a senior level manager, I want to be able to encrypt all of my passwords and stored them on the cloud at the same time, so that when I access my sensitive information, it can not be accessed by anyone else but myself with the encryption key. </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Web Application</h3>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The product will come with a web-application. Users would be able to use this application to generate new passwords and 2FA codes, store their existing passwords, and export information.</p>
        <p><b>Validation:</b> The user should be able to access their passwords, 2FA codes, generate and store new passwords, and export the passwords with the web-application.</p>
        <p><b>User Story:</b> As a University Student, I want to be able to have access to all my passwords, store new ones and export them all in the same place. I want to do this because I work on my laptop for both personal and professional uses.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Export Passwords and 2FA Seeds</h3>
        <p><b>Description:</b> With the application, the users would be able to export their passwords and 2FA keys in case they decide to discontinue their use of the application.</p>
        <p><b>Validation:</b> To test this feature, the user should be able to click on the Export button and then be able to download a JSON file containing all their passwords.</p>
        <p><b>User Story:</b> As a Security Analyst, I want to export all of my passwords and 2FA keys, so that when I am leaving work to work from home, I have all my passwords necessary for the websites needed to be used.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Extended Features:</h2>

        <br>

        <h3>Organize Passwords</h3>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The users would be able to organize their passwords into different categories such as Entertainment, Games, Work, etc.</p>
        <p><b>Validation:</b> In order to validate this feature, the user should be able to create different categories and then tag a password to a particular category.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Find Leaked Passwords</h3>
        <p><b>Description:</b> Often websites store the user passwords in plaintext and whenever they are hacked, the passwords end up on the dark web. This feature would involve detecting and finding the leaked passwords and informing the user to update their password automatically.</p>
        <p><b>Validation:</b> To check the successful implementation of this feature, the user should store a generic password such as "p@ssword" and the application should advise them to change it as soon as possible as the password is already leaked on the Internet.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Password Update Remainder</h3>
        <p><b>Description:</b> Websites such as banks and wallets often require the users to update their password every few weeks. The user should be able to set reminders to update their passwords frequently on sensitive websites such as banks.</p>
        <p><b>Validation:</b> A successful implementation would mean that the user is able to set a reminder for a website such as a bank to update their password every 3 weeks. The user should see an alert at the application as well as get an email when they are due for a password change.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Project Motivation</h2>

        <p><b>Motivation:</b> As a group, we all share similar interests within the cybersecurity area which the password manager, Passfree, is in. Some of us already have experience within the field or want to go into the cybersecurity field, therefore this is a great step to broaden our knowledge in cybersecurity and it can help build our confidence towards a better version in the future. Some of us within the group as well were excited by the idea on creating something that could be quite complex, motivating us to challenge something we never thought we could create. With some of the team
            members already having knowledge regarding this area of topic and the challenge aspect of the idea, it just motivated us to build upon this project.</p>
        <p><b>Interests Relating to Project:</b> As most of us want to challenge ourselves as our knowledge isn't extensive within the cybersecurity field, this project will help to develop our skills and broaden our knowledge. With the help of other team members who are quite knowledgable within this field, they can definitely help us expand our knowledge, experience and skills in many areas. This goes for some members who are not confident in the back end and coding of projects as it will help their skill set if they work with someone who may have experience in that area. We do have members
            that
            have an interest in coding or creating programs/applications that can definitely benefit us and the project.</p>
        <p><b>Relation to Introduction to IT:</b> Within Introduction to IT, a few team members actually pitched an idea for a password manager or something to do with an application. Some other team members had the project ideas of video games, some were relating in helping cybersecurity and other targetted other IT related issues. The few that had the password manager within Introduction to IT helped fleshed out the idea and expand to create the ideas, features and concept we have now. The others that had application have assisted in expanding the ease of use for this project and the
            likeliness it can affect people using the project. With the feedback we received over time within Introduction to IT are considered, even if some members did the video game idea, just so we can cover all bases and create a product that can be beneficial.</p>

    <div class="container">

        <h1>Justification</h1>

        <h3>Justified Workload</h3>
        <p><b>Total Workload:</b> 240hrs</p>
        <p><b>Per Person a Week (8 weeks total):</b> 5hrs</p>
        <p><b>Total Workload per Part (estimation):</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Part 1: 30 hrs</li>
            <li>Part 2: 110 hrs</li>
            <li>Part 3: 100 hrs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As part one is the least strenuous of the three parts it should only require a total of 30 full hours, given all members are active and present. We believe it can be achieved and so we can allocate more active time to the second and third parts as they will take the most effort and active time to accomplish to a satisfactory level. Part one is a planning stage, hence the majority of the estimated time will be to workout the team dynamic and the project itself to make sure we have a structured timeline and succinct idea of every feature and direction we are going to take and to
            assign the roles based on level of skill of each member. </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Beyond Current Capabilities</h3>
        <p><b>UI/UX:</b> 4.5/5</p>
        <p><b>Coding (JavaScript/PHP):</b> 2/5</p>
        <p><b>HTML/CSS:</b> 3.5/5</p>
        <p><b>Time Management:</b> 3.5/5</p>
        <p>Of the four major components that will lead to a successful completion, coding is the weakest and UI/UX knowledge is the highest.
            We plan to each hold each other accountable in terms of time management and communication. We have had the time to talk through our strengths and weaknesses and how we will work together and what we expect of each other though the project. The group dynamic has been decided and with common ground between all of us we are able to both speak on a personal and strict level to invite a positive atmosphere between us that allows us to speak freely as we work.
            In terms of the lacking skills we have divided our team into those who are comfortable to 'dive in the deep end' and ready to take time to learn new skills to achieve our goals and the other half of our team are our supporting coders who we will teach these skills to and will be able to sift through our work and spot mistakes before we commit everything.
            The supporting coders will take an a majority of the HTML and CSS components as they want to improve their proficiency but find taking on Javascript and PHP head on to be out of their reach for the moment. Hence, why the main coders will be guiding and teaching and willing to make the effort to learn JavaScript and PHP to a proficient level to be able to help them learn and understand structure and syntax. </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Project Risks</h3>
        <p><b>Project Risk 1:</b> Lack of skill</p>
        <p>Not all members are highly proficient in Javascript and PHP we will need to self-study and learn those skills out of our own volition to be able to complete the project ourselves without having to jeopardize our project ideas and force ourselves to improvise into something new in the last minute. We also intend for the team members lacking knowledge to seek help from other members that may be more experienced to ensure that the lack of skill will not prevent us from progressing. </p>
        <p><b>Project Risk 2:</b> Lack of originality</p>
        <p>Our idea is not completely new and may lack originality to it. However, we hope to remedy that by being able to improve on those that are currently existing with both a better UI/UX design and functionality. We have also come up with features for our password manager that will set us apart from competitors such as the 2FA and reminder feature. </p>
        <p><b>Project Risk 3:</b> Scheduling and timing</p>
        <p>Even if we give ourselves a succinct timeline to follow, there are many factors and variables that can affect our ability to reach those set deadlines which would cause a pushback of any other activities we have planned in our timeline and that would cause stress and last minute rush to have this completed. In order to minimise this risk, we aim to plan ahead and alert other members if there are any last minute obstacles that may hinder us working on the project so that a suitable solution can be found. </p>

        <p><b>Team Risk 1:</b> Other subjects</p>
        <p>As we continue in the semester we all have other subjects that may take more of our time. We may lose our balance and in worst case, neglect the work we have to do as a group. Due to this, we may find that some members are lagging behind and others may feel overwhlemed by the pressure a group project can demand. To ensure we make enough time for this project, we will let the team know when we are able and unable to set time aside. </p>
        <p><b>Team Risk 2:</b> Team arguments</p>
        <p>Arguments may arise due to disagreements and the relationship between the members involved may affect our ability to work efficiently and comfortably. To prevent this, communication will be a key factor in keeping the group together and in working out any issues.</p>
        <p><b>Team Risk 3:</b> Personal commitments</p>
        <p>Each person, for one reason or another will have personal issues or commitments that will take time away from them. For most of us it will be a work commitment which changes team meeting schedules to be able to suit them as we require all memeber to be active in team meetings. Otherwise, they will not be able to have an equal say to our project. As a group, we will need to organise meeting times and coordinate around everyone's schedule to ensure that we have time for both project related and personal commitments. </p>
