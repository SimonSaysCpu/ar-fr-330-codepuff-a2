        <h1>Contract</h1>
        <p><b>Expectations:</b></p>
        <p>The expectations for the team CodePuff during the duration of Building I.T Systems (COSC2625) should all be agreed upon, as it is our duty to meet these requirements. With these expectations, they will also be following all RMIT guidelines for Academic Integrity purposes. Any and all acts against these guidelines, revolving the contract and RMIT's Academic Integrity will be dealt with appropriately. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Within this project assignment, there will be guidelines in place within this contract that the team CodePuff must follow. These guidelines are but not limited to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>All meetings to be attended; Not attending these meetings can directly impact your grade for the course and alongside all your teammates grade.</li>
            <li>All meetings to be recorded with the consent of everyone within the meeting. No meeting will commence if there is a lack on consent from every team member present. This will also return a direct impact on grades.</li>
            <li>Meetings that do happen, to happen minimum of once a week, with more required when necessary. This to ensure all team members are on the same page of the project alongside to keep everyone up to date professionally.</li>
            <li>Activity of messages should and will be consistent. All messages that are sent within group communications should be checked regularly to make sure any team members with questions or help are not left in the dark regarding any project work.</li>
            <li>All attendee's follow all guidelines put inplace by RMIT and the course. Failure to do so can directly impact grades for this course, and potentially other courses.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Section regarding Specific Tasks, Responsibilies and due dates:</b></p>
        <p>Regarding the assignment for COSC2625, the project will have specific details that will have to be followed and kept in mind as the progression to the final product becomes apparent.</p>
        <p>Project specific requirements this contract has agreed on are, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With every official due dute of the assignment for the course, finishing two days early as it can give us a grace period to reassure all features work and the clients are satisfied.</li>
            <li>Goals within the project and team are kept clear and concise. Personal goals and achievements must take into factor other team members goals.</li>
            <li>Roles that are assigned are assigned for a reason, therefore following what deadlines that have been placed regarding the area you are assigned to. All roles must work within their area, however are happy to help others if need be.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>The Process of Dealing with Unmet Expectations:</b></p>
        <p>If potentially, there are requirements that are not met and/or problems that have arised, necessary actions will be required to deal with the risk that could impact everyone. </p>
        <p>If there is team discourse, the issue will be addressed in an appropriate manner to resolve the issue. Any bullying of any means will not be tolerated and any arguments will be dealt with appropriately and in a timely fashion. </p>
        <p>If there are issues regarding the morality of where some information was gathered from, necessary actions will be required from the team, as in the removal of information or editing of information. If not done so, the information will be picked up by the education staff and will directly affect the team as a whole.</p>


        <p><b>An Agreed Method for Feedback:</b></p>
        <p>During the project, all team members will receive feedback on how they are progressing through consistent check ups on their progress within team messages and also how often they contribute to the Github and other project necessary applications. With this, if problems arise during the process of the project, receiving feedback through peers will be necessary via messages. As we hope no problems arise, each individual will still receive feedback to make sure everyone is on the same page.</p>

        <p><b>Expected Frequency of Responses:</b></p>
        <p>As mentioned, there will be group messages to keep contact with each other on how everything is going in relation to the project. However, frequency of responses may vary as we strive for consistency everywhere within our project. </p>
        <p>For every message that is a question, it is expected for every person to answer if necessary to the message. If not necessary, the required people should respond if they can in a timely matter, no delaying if possible. Ideally we would be striving for same day response within a reasonable time. The same goes for when another member needs assistance in the project, to have aid in their matter as soon as possible.</p>

        <p><b>Tools used within a weekly flow:</b></p>
        <p>During the duration of the project, tools should be used consistently and frequently to meet deadline requirements. All tools being used will include but not limited to Github, Amazon Web Services, PHPStorm, Laravel, Nginx and MySQL. The use of these applications are expected to be used often, ideally weekly, so that all deadlines required by the course are met and some goes for any personal deadlines the team have set. </p>
