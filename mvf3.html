        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Master key encryption is a concept that will be implemented to protect cryptographic keys and all other keys on a system.
            The advantage to a master key is to provide maximum security which makes it near impossible for attackers to access any sensitive data or information.
            This is wanted in a password manager application as users will expect that if they are storing all their account details within a single point it would not allow breaches.
            As in its name master key encryption, refers to having a master key. This one master key is only used to encrypt and decipher other keys, or commonly refered to as "secret keys".
            The secret keys are what actually encrypt plaintext and decrypt ciphertext.
        </p>
        <p>The encryption standard that will be implements will be CBC AES-256. CBC is known as cipher block chaining and AES is advanced encryption standard. In AEs-256, the 256 refers to a key length of 256 bits.
            This is the maximum security currently and is considered so because against a crute force attack it contains 1.1x10^77 possible combinations to crack through.
            In summary, it would take an extremely long time to be able to achieve a correct result because of the complexity of CBC.
        </p>

        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p>In order to validate the usability of this feature, the user must set up an account at Passfree and then login to their account using their email address and password.
            After that, they must generate a password for any website requiring login access and then save it in their profile.</p>
        <p>There will be an option to create the master key. This will be the master key encryption validation check, that will ask for the user to enter a chosen master key password.
            It will also ask for a second confirmation of the password written to make sure the user has not made a typing error when choosing their password.
            A password strength will alsoshow the user if their master key is weak, medium or strong. This may be important to users who value guarding their information strictly.
        </p>
